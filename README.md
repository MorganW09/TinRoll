# TinRoll
A stackoverflow clone built with C# + EF Core for the backend and React for the front end. Right now it's very feature bare. You can ask text only questions and can view them in a list. 


# Running Locally

DB Setup: 

1. Install Sql Server
2. Right now TinRoll is defaulted to use localdb instance. 
3. Run src/api/TinRoll.Migrations/updateDatabase.ps1 script to create local database.
4. If that fails, try logging into sql server instance through SSMS and creating the `TinRollDb` manually then rerunning the script. Some versions of LocalDb have a bug around creating databases.

API Setup:

1. Download Visual Studio Code
2. Open up the API folder in Visual Studio Code.
3. You should be prompted to install some extensions, the ionide plugin allowing F# support.
4. Edit the API to your heart's content.
5. You can either run the project from Visual Studio Code, or un the src/api/run.ps1 script to launch the API.

UI Setup:

1. In src/ui folder, run `npm install`.
2. Run `npm run start`
3. Navigate browser to `localhost:8080` to access the UI.
